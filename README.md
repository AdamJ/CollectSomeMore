# CollectSomeMore
> Also known as GamesAndThings on the iOS AppStore

[![Swift](https://github.com/AdamJ/CollectSomeMore/actions/workflows/swift.yml/badge.svg?branch=testflight)](https://github.com/AdamJ/CollectSomeMore/actions/workflows/swift.yml)

My first attempt at creating an iOS app using SwiftUI. At this time, the app is only available through TestFlight by invitation only.

## Data Storage and Privacy

All user data entered into CollectSomeMore is stored locally on your device using Core Data (SwiftData). No data is uploaded to any cloud service or external server. Your data remains private and is only accessible on your device.

**Backup and Restore:**
- If you back up your device using iCloud or your computer, your app data (including collections) will be included in the backup and restored if you restore your device.
- The app developer does not have access to your data; it is managed by you and Appleâ€™s backup system.
