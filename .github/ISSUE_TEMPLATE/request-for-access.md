I, [username] would like to request access to the CollectSomeMore/GamesAndThings iOS app that is currently being tested through TestFlight.

By requesting access, I understand that the application is currently in beta and that any information entered into the app may be deleted at any time. Additionally, any information that is entered into the app during this beta period is not guaranteed to carry over when the app is released through the AppStore.
